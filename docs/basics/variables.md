# Variables

Variables are like `containers` that hold a `value`.

The type of `value` is the `DataType`


## DataType

- Number
- Character (ie. 'a', 'b', 'c', etc...)
- Array (Special)
- Boolean


### Number

As simple as it sounds, a number can have many different datatypes.

- `float` or `double` are decimal-point numbers, difference is in its accuracy (@advanced: how does a computer store numbers & therefore whats the difference between the 2?)
- `int` is used to store a whole number (@advanced: does it always store in base 10?)


### Characters

Characters refer to a single, ONE letter. 

> Of course 1 letter is pretty useless unless it can be used as a String. 

A String is an [array](#array) of characters, allowing multiple characters to be stored in 1 vairable, that is a String.


### Array

An array is a special data type, it is able to store multiple variables in 1 variable. (re-read that to take it in).


### Boolean 

A boolean is a variable that only have 2 states:
- 1 or 0
- True or False. 
- Yes or No

It is usually a DataType of its own in MOST high level programming langauges.


## Advanced
(@advanced) Primitive vs Derived DataTypes:
Derived DataTypes are when a programmer defines their own Datatype using the primitive ones (@google)
